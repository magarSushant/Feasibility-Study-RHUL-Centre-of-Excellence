# RHUL Emerging Industries Feasibility Study

## Overview
This project, conducted as part of a group presentation at Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL), focuses on assessing the feasibility and strategy for establishing a Centre for Emerging Industries (RHUL_CEI) in the Runnymede region. The aim is to foster the growth and sustainability of emerging industries by leveraging regional strengths, technological innovations, and cross-sector collaboration.

Our analysis dives into regional entrepreneurial ecosystems, policy frameworks, and support services to determine the potential of RHUL_CEI as a specialized center. By examining sectors like cybersecurity, cleantech, and creative technologies, we proposed strategies to position the center as a key player in regional industrial growth.

## Project Objectives
- **Identify existing support centers** for emerging industries and map available services.
- **Enable university members** to translate their expertise into actionable initiatives for regional development.
- **Promote collaboration** across sectors and stimulate entrepreneurial activities, particularly among SMEs and start-ups.
- **Analyze economic trends** and policy directives in the Runnymede region that affect emerging industries.

## Key Highlights
- **Emerging Industries Defined**: The project identified key emerging sectors such as **cybersecurity**, **cleantech**, and **creative technologies**. These industries are marked by high growth potential, reliance on cross-sector collaboration, and the ability to transform traditional sectors.
  
- **Regional Feasibility**: Runnymede was found to have a conducive environment for fostering innovation, with access to a skilled workforce, research institutions, and support from the local council. However, challenges such as **skills shortages** and **high operating costs** were identified, which RHUL_CEI aims to address.

- **RHUL_CEI Portfolio**: Our strategy for the RHUL_CEI includes services like bespoke training, industry collaboration events, policy advocacy, and funding opportunities to support entrepreneurs and SMEs in emerging sectors.

RHUL_CEI would benefit from alignment with these policy frameworks, securing a strategic position within the region’s growth plans.

### 5. **Entrepreneurship Snapshot – Runnymede Borough**
The borough's entrepreneurial landscape includes a strong **business outlook** with optimism for growth, though it faces challenges like below-average **startup rates** and **skills shortages**. However, there is a positive **exporting activity** and a growing commitment to **research and development (R&D)**.

#### Feasibility Impact:
While the entrepreneurial ecosystem shows room for growth, the positive business outlook and R&D investments indicate a supportive environment for RHUL_CEI’s initiatives.

### Strengths:
- **High Competitiveness**: Ranked as one of the most competitive regions outside London, Runnymede is home to 20% of large Surrey-based companies and leads in sectors like IT and communication.
- **Policy Alignment**: The region’s economic strategies, including the Levelling Up white paper, align with national goals to tackle economic disparities and support industrial innovation.

### Challenges:
- **Skills Shortages**: Despite a skilled workforce, sectors like cybersecurity and immersive technologies face talent shortages, underscoring the need for targeted training and upskilling.
- **High Operating Costs**: The cost of rent and utilities remains prohibitive for smaller businesses, requiring tailored financial support solutions.

## Strategic Recommendations
The group recommends adopting a **hybrid approach** for RHUL_CEI, focusing on both tech-driven sectors like cybersecurity and cleantech while embracing other emerging industries such as tourism and film. Collaboration across sectors will maximize innovation, job creation, and economic growth for the region.
